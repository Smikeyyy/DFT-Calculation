# DFT-Calculation
Perform DFT+U calculation on LaFeO3 Anti-Ferromagnetic G-Type to calculate DOS

Make and organize file into following folders to run:
1. "direct" -> scf, nscf, projwfc
2. "pseudo" -> La, Fe, O pseudopotential
3. "out" -> output

How to run in bach linux shell:
1. chmod +x calculation_new.sh -> change permission to executable
2. ./calculation_new.sh -> execute bash script

Output files after running:
projected density of state of each atom orbitals
